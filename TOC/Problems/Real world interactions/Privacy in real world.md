title: "Privacy in real world"
---
- Meta showed a vision of people wearing their AR glasses in the real world, recording the surrounding so people with VR headsets can experience it too (ie. on a music concert)
	- will it be recording other people? can people opt-out from the recording?
- Meta's vision on recording and labeling user's vision (while wearing AR glasses) - https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-here-comes-the-ai-of-the-metaverse/
	- possible use-case "When did I read books to my children" and the system would search through the recorded history
- they also showed a vision of having a copy of user's house in VR - [[Meta#Horizon Home]]
	- will it be accessible to strangers?
