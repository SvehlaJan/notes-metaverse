title: "Social engineering attacks"

- social engineering attacks will eventually move to Metaverse too
- the malicious actor might be extracting sensitive information, by asking seemingly harmless questions about the virtual environment (ie. copy of user's house in [[Meta#Horizon Home]])
- malicious actors might hide behind fake avatars - [[Identity verification]] might help here
- education and raising awareness might be the most helpful but very difficult
