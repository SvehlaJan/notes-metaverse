- Metaverse is very broad term
- it is not a single app -what Facebook/Meta is showing or what was shown in Ready Player one (although it might get there)
- it will be a multiverse of metaverses
- it isn't a future state, it is already there
	- many projects already are some kind of Metaverse - Fortnite, Roblox, - 
- current internet is about transactions - buying stuff, information access, consuming content
- Metaverse is mainly about real-time immersive experiences, activity-centric - the user is present in the virtual world and is a part of it
	- immersive - think about it as giving us the illusion of a _place_ we are in; and when I use “we” what’s inherent in that is that the _self is present_ in this place.
- question is whether the 3D world is required - if ie. Clubhouse is part of Metaverse
	- reason to think about it is that it provides the illusion of being in a room with a group of people engaging in the activities like learning, socializing and conversation
- a lot of reasoning/relevance is in games - they are activity-based - people 
	- activity-based - similar as in games
- a lot of content will be telling stories, informing
- most of the content will come from creators (independent?) - exponential rise expected
- supported by real-time technology, immersive stuff, being in places and spaces
- workspace
	- it was asynchronous - Slack messages, or initiating a Zoom call
	- Metaverse - more real-time, everyone in the same place, environment
- everyone says that it needs to be decentralised, I don't see this requirement so crucial
- it will eventually inherit all jobs of television

The process of building the metaverse is being driven by:
-   **Activities:** mainstreaming of immersive experience — those where you don’t simplify look at pages and apps, but engage in activities with others within **places**.
-   **Creator-driven:** both the tools to create your own activities, as well as creator economies that enable users to add content to them, will enable non-technical folks to shape the metaverse.
-   **Embedding and Linking of Emergent Content:** just as hyperlinks and embedded content became the connective tissue of prior generations of the Internet, the ability to bridge and layer elements of the immersive internet together will power the next emergent wave of innovation. We may need new terms — _hyperportals_ and _hyperstreams_?
